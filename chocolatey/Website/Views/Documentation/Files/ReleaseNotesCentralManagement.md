## 0.4.0 (November 6, 2020)
### BREAKING CHANGES
 * Deployments - Machine contact timeout now defaults to infinite (0) to allow for semi-connected environments

Previously this value was set to a constant value of 20 and not configurable. To revert to previous behaviour, set the machine contact timeout in minutes value for a given deployment step to 20.

### FEATURES
 * Deployment Scheduling
   * Scheduled Deployments allows for starting a deployment at some point in the future
   * Maintenance Windows - Ability to specify date and time for when no more computers within a deployment can start
 * API - Swagger UI allows visualization and interaction with all CCM API operations - see [Licensed #183](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-licensed-issues/issues/183)
 * Long Running Deployments - Enables support for semi-connected computers

### BUG FIXES
 * Fix - Deployments - Computers marked unreachable should not be picked up in future steps in same deployment
 * Fix - Deployments - Adding distinct groups that share computers to a deployment results in duplicated computers within deployment steps
