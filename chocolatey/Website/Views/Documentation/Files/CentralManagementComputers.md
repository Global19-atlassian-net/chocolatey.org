## Registering a New Computer

Client computers (agents) will show up in Central Management automatically as long as long as these conditions are met for the client computer:

1. The `chocolatey`, `chocolatey.extension`, and `chocolatey-agent` packages are installed, alongside a valid Chocolatey for Business license.
1. The `useChocolateyCentralManagement` feature is enabled.
1. The `centralManagementServiceUrl` is set correctly in the chocolatey configuration file (typically to `https://<FQDN_to_CCM_service_host>:24020/ChocolateyManagementService`)
1. The client has access to the above URL (this may require opening the port in your firewall, etc.) so that it can resolve the SSL certificate necessary to communicate with the CCM service.

Please see [[Central Management Client Setup|CentralManagementSetupClient]] for more details and setup.

## Common Errors and Resolutions
### Computers are not showing up in CCM
You need to check the CCM service logs. The agent will always report success when it communicates with the service successfully. The service may reject what it receives, but due to security settings, it won't tell the client about that.

The logs are located at `$env:ChocolateyInstall\logs\ccm-service.log`. If you are on a version of CCM prior to 0.2.0, the log will be located at `$env:ChocolateyInstall\lib\chocolatey-management-service\tools\service\logs\chocolatey.service.host.log`.

For more common errors related to checking in, see the [[setup section (and component setup sub-sections)|CentralManagementSetup]] as they dive deeper into common errors and resolutions related to things such as this.
